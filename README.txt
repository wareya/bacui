bacui is a mupen64plus frontend.

bacui depends on SDL2 and curses. The directives for cursive may need to be modified to compile bacui on other platforms.

bacui does not (yet) come with a mupen64plus core/plugins bundle.

bacui is not yet enduser-ready. bacui is meant to be a debugger, so in-interface configuration is a last priority.
